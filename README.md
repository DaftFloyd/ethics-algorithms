Ethics of Algorithms - Problems and Solutions

Abstract:
Research on the ethics of algorithms has grown substantially over the past decade. Alongside the
exponential development and application of machine learning algorithms, new ethical problems and
solutions relating to their ubiquitous use in society have been proposed. This article builds on a review
of the ethics of algorithms published in 2016 (Mittelstadt et al. 2016). The goals are to contribute to
the debate on the identification and analysis of the ethical implications of algorithms, to provide an
updated analysis of epistemic and normative concerns, and to offer actionable guidance for the
governance of the design, development and deployment of algorithms.

Key words:
Algorithm, Artificial Intelligence, Autonomy, Digital Ethics, Explainability, Fairness,
Machine Learning, Privacy, Responsibility, Transparency, Trust.
